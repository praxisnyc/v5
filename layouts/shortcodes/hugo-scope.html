<p>We automatically adds post slug as an <code>html</code> class, so if your post url is <code>domain/category/post/</code> your <code>html</code> also has a class <code>play-post</code> (it starts with <code>play-</code> to prevent any conflict).</p>
<p>You can also create a more generic style (for multiple pages) by adding <code>style: style-name</code> on frontmatter. It will also appear as a class on <code>html</code>.</p>
