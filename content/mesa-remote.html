<h2>What is Mesa</h2>

<p>Mesa is a gesture-based AR communal whiteboard.</p>

<p>Built upon a gesture library, Mesa provides an open-source AR environment for task-specific apps. Created with community use in mind, Mesa can recognize and respond to simultaneous actions of multiple users.</p>

<p>Mesa is hardware-agnostic, allowing for comprehensive setup and calibration with easily found hardware: camera (input), projector (output) and a computer.</p>

<h2>Remote Work with Mesa</h2>

<p>Built on a serverless network, Mesa can bring a secure and synchronous whiteboard experience to collaborators across the world. Simply put, users don't have to be in the same location to make use of Mesa.</p>
